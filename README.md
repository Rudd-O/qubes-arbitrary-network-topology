# Qubes arbitrary network topology

This software lets you turn your [Qubes OS 4.0](https://www.qubes-os.org/) machine into
an arbitrary network topology host.  It is ideal to create networks of interconnected VMs with arbitrary pathways between them, and minimal effort compared to manually setting everything up using `xl attach` in your `dom0` as `root`.

**Note**: this software only supports release 4.0 of Qubes OS.

The rest of the documentation remains to be written.
